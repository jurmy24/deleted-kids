# Exercise types in Utter stories

These are the exercise types that will be used in the Utter stories automatically. These exercises may exist for all levels of difficulty but the specific difficulty of each question will be set using a tag (A1/A2/B1/B2/C1).

We refer to singular exercises and units of story as exercise blocks and story blocks, respectively.

## Comprehension

3. The correct answer must be the exact same as the last part of the text.
4. The three answer options must be similar.

```

## Pronunciation

In these exercises the learner needs to practice closed-form speaking, meaning that they do not need to come up with words themselves but rather repeat a provided text with their audio being evaluated, just like Duolingos pronunciation exercises.

### Repetition

- action: visually specify the piece of text to be repeated and provide a button to press to start speaking
- evaluation: some live pronunciation evaluator
- description: an exercise to check the pronunciation of the user after hearing the text spoken just before
- skip-condition: when voice is toggled off

**generator prompt:**

```
Select a very short section of the following text for the user to read aloud:
----
{previous StoryBlock}
----

Follow the rules:

1. The exercise must be written for {cefr} CEFR level {language}.
2. The chosen text must be shorter than or equal to one sentence.

Go!
```

### Deaf

- type: pronounce-deaf
- action: turn off audio in the final section of the story block for the user to pronounce it on behalf of the character then display a button to start speaking
- evaluation: some live pronunciation evaluator
- description: an exercise to check the pronunciation of the user before hearing it
- skip-condition: when voice is toggled off

**generator prompt:**

```
Select the final part of the following text for the user to read aloud:

```

**generator prompt:**
